      Since the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) passed in 2005, coupon redemption rates in class action coupon settlements have become the essential element for plaintiff attorneys and class members alike. The law makes clear that if a class action settlement involves coupon reimbursements, the plaintiff’s attorney fees should be based on the value of coupons that are redeemed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, CAFA motivated plaintiffs’ attorneys to get as much value as possible out of the coupons issued in settlements by raising their redemption rates. The class relies on the coupon to attain relief from the settlement, while the plaintiffs' bar relies on the class to redeem the coupons in order to be justly compensated for their work in the case.

    <p>
      As the coupon consultant, coupon administrator, and coupon market maker, Chicago Clearing Corporation (CCC) is ready to efficiently and skillfully facilitate a high the coupon redemption rate according to the standards set by the act in the Korean Air settlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the most notable post-CAFA coupon settlement, the Linen Antitrust Litigation, CCC played a major role negotiating with seven linen defendants to create the most valuable coupon possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite the complexity that came with regulating redemption payments among seven defendants, CCC’s expertise in creating, facilitating and administrating secondary coupon markets resulted in an exceptionally high redemption rate of 93%. This success is attributed to CCC’s successful creation of secondary markets in numerous coupon settlements over 20 years and its comprehensive and unique knowledge of past coupon settlement redemption models.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the experience in the Linen settlement and over two dozen other settlements, CCC’s singular institutional knowledge and extensive experience will help create an effective redemption process for the Korean Air Litigation. After setting up a hosting a bilingual call center and transactional website, CCC will facilitate the transaction of $36 million in coupons and assist over 93,000 class members in the redemption or sale of their coupons.
    </p>

    <p>
      CCC understands better than anyone how to ensure a fair settlement under CAFA and create value for the class and the plaintiff’s attorneys.
