  <h3>A post-CAFA world</h3>
    <p> Tracking redemption rates is vital for plaintiffs' attorneys. CCC works in conjunction with settlement administrators (or as the settlement administrator), overseeing the coupon portion of settlements and tracking coupon usage and redemption rates. By acting as the custodian and administrator for coupons issued to class members, CCC is able to facilitate transfers where applicable, promoting a secondary market and bolstering redemption rates.
    CCC has worked directly with many of the largest settlement administrators to efficiently administer class action coupon settlements. By administering cases, CCC is able to supervise the activity of coupons post-distribution, providing powerful redemption tracking and reporting services. The high level of oversight and comprehensive redemption tracking provided by CCC give plaintiffs' attorneys peace of mind, knowing their hard-earned fees will not be driven down by lackluster redemption rates.
