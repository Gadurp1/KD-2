    CCC’s expertise in creating secondary markets is what differentiates us from other coupon settlement administrators. We stand alone as the premier expert and market maker in class action coupon settlements.
    In pre-CAFA days, class actions were settled regardless of their prospective redemption rates. As a result, most coupon settlements ended up with low redemption rates, failing to rightfully compensate class members who had been allegedly harmed by the defendant. Many plaintiff’s attorneys were criticized for not abiding by their fiduciary duties and became reluctant to utilize non-monetary relief in settling antitrust class actions.
    In any class action that results in a coupon settlement, it is reasonable to assume that not all coupons issued will be redeemed by the original claimants. The reason for electing not to redeem a coupon can vary, from not wanting to promote the defendant’s business, to having no plan to use the coupon within the redemption period. Whatever the reason may be, unused coupons will certainly bring no value to the original claimants. Considering most coupon settlements without a vibrant secondary market experience a 2 - 3% redemption rate, CCC’s efforts to actively seek demands for unused coupons and match them with the original claimants is crucial.
    Throughout the entire process, CCC helps everyone benefit. The original claimants who otherwise would have received no value from the settlement can receive real monetary value. Coupon purchasers can obtain coupons from the market at a discount from face value. And plaintiffs’ attorneys can report a high redemption rate to the court, ensuring that their full-value award is CAFA-compliant.

    CCC began making secondary markets in coupon settlements in 1993 and has paid over $225,000,000 to class members for 16 unique settlements. (need to double check on statistics).
    The main tasks as a coupon maker involve:
    Potentially conducting an auction or series of auctions, matching buyers and sellers
    Negotiating post-auction transactions between buyers and sellers
    Brokering private transactions between buyers and sellers of coupons
    Purchasing coupons from prospective sellers (as a dealer) and reselling them to prospective buyers of coupons to liquidate the market.

  The followings are some of the coupon settlement cases successfully administered by CCC.
  In re: Linens Antitrust Litigation, 03-CV-7823 (S.D NY, October 3, 2003)
  A price-fixing antitrust case that concerned (amount) vouchers for linen services in and around New York City. CCC acted as the voucher consultant, administrator and market maker. Specifically in the market making capacity, CCC acted as a broker for the vouchers, matching buyers and sellers and arranging online auctions. After three unique redemption periods each spanning 9 months from date of issuance, CCC facilitated a 93% rate of redemption.
  → I want to have the market price (percentage) so that plaintiff’s attorneys can get a general sense of what their return will be but I don’t know if 40-50% return will discourage them from the beginning.

  2) In re: Lloyd’s American Trust Fund Litigation, 96 Civ. 1262 (S.D. NY, May 8, 2002)
  A breach of contract and fiduciary duty antitrust case that concerned $11,500,000 worth of Lloyd’s Credit Notes that could be used to reinsure one’s liabilities for prior underwriting.
  Credit Notes were distributed according to each class member’s amount of debt. CCC stepped in as the broker of auctions between class members. CCC facilitated transactions of about 67% of distributed credit notes, an extremely high rate, considering the fact that many class members had used their own credit notes to eliminate their debt.

  3) In re: Auction Houses Antitrust Litigation, 00-CV-00648 (S.D. NY, April 12, 2001)
  Another price-fixing antitrust case that concerned $125 million worth of certificates for consignment charges such as mission fees, risk of loss or insurance fees, and illustration charges at either Sotheby’s or Christie’s.
  Each auction house issued $62.5 million in face value of certificates. (For Sotheby’s?) of the $32 million worth of certificates redeemed, CCC’s active role as the market maker resulted in certificate redemption of $30 million, 93% of the total value of the redeemed certificates. For Christie’s _______

  4) Princeton Economics Group, Inc. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, No. L-91-3321 (N.J. Sup. Ct., March 17, 1995)
  Product defect antitrust case that concerned 3,200,000 freely transferable coupons that had worth up to a maximum face value of $50 per coupon.

  Coupon holders were entitled one of the following options:  
  - 20% discount off the best-negotiated price on selected AT&T phone systems  
  - 20% discount toward the purchase of a 4-year maintenance contract  
  - 20% discount toward the purchase of selected phone products from AT&T's sourcebook  

  CCC bought and sold approximately 260,000 coupons. Outside of CCC, approximately 150,000 coupons were redeemed, less than 5% of the total amount of coupons. As the market maker, CCC more than doubled the amount of coupons that were redeemed, displaying CCC’s ability to effectively help the class reclaim their losses.
  CCC could have facilitated the transaction of more coupons, however AT&T covertly shut down the market for coupons by rendering coupons unredeemable at stores and not accepting coupons from vendors. As a part of a class, CCC sued AT&T for effectively closing the market before the coupons expired. CCC and the rest of the class won the case and were awarded $15 million.

  Coupon Administrator
  In a post-CAFA world, tracking redemption rates is vital for plaintiffs' attorneys. CCC works in conjunction with settlement administrators (or as the settlement administrator), overseeing the coupon portion of settlements and tracking coupon usage and redemption rates. By acting as the custodian and administrator for coupons issued to class members, CCC is able to facilitate transfers where applicable, promoting a secondary market and bolstering redemption rates.
  CCC has worked directly with many of the largest settlement administrators to efficiently administer class action coupon settlements. By administering cases, CCC is able to supervise the activity of coupons post-distribution, providing powerful redemption tracking and reporting services. The high level of oversight and comprehensive redemption tracking provided by CCC give plaintiffs' attorneys peace of mind, knowing their hard-earned fees will not be driven down by lackluster redemption rates.

  The main tasks as a coupon administrator involve:
  Designing and distributing coupons and related materials
  Coordinating mechanisms of redemption with the defendants
  Creating and maintaining coupon settlement website, complete with contact info and coupon-specific FAQ
  Staffing, training and maintaining a call center to respond to queries regarding the coupons
  Tracking coupon use/redemption through proprietary database
  Providing dispute resolution mechanisms for coupons
