      <h4>CCC Relieves the Hassle of Filing Antitrust Claims</h4>

  <p>
    Each day, billions of dollars are available to consumers in antitrust class actions. (Yes, that’s with a “b”.) Buyers of goods and services ⎯ anything from apples to zippers ⎯ can recover cash as a result of past purchases. But the process of recovering that money can be complicated. Tracking thousands of antitrust cases is a burden. Compiling and analyzing decades’ worth of purchase data is a job in and of itself. Responding to administrators’ endless questions quickly becomes a headache. Any little misstep during the filing process can cost you thousands of dollars. Long story short: it’s a nightmare.
  </p>
  <h4>Why put up with all of that?</h4>
  <p>
    You don’t need to. Chicago Clearing Corporation (CCC), the leading class action claim filing specialist, makes antitrust claim filing virtually effortless. We handle the entire antitrust claim filing process from beginning to end, notifying you of relevant litigations, and distributing your recovery to fit your needs. You’ll even receive custom reports so that you can track the status of your filings. We’ll help you recover money you never knew you were entitled to.

    Money on the Table

    More than $15 billion in class action settlements paid out in the last few years, and another $7+ billion are expected to be distributed in 2016. CCC has recovered $200MM in settlement funds for its 1,280+ clients since 2009 alone. Why not join the rapidly growing list of happy CCC users and leave the pain of filing claims to CCC?
