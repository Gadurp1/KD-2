          <p>In 1993, Jim founded Certificate Clearing Corporation (“CCC”), and under his leadership the firm has become the preeminent class action coupon market-maker in the United States. Over the course of twenty years, CCC has recovered over $200 million dollars for harmed class members in 20 (25?) unique class action settlements.</p>
          <p>
          Jim has served as an expert witness in countless class action lawsuits, and has sat as a member of an advisory panel before the Federal Trade Commission. He has been cited in The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The San Francisco Daily Law Bulletin, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, and Crain’s Chicago Business, among other outlets. Jim and his team pioneered many of the most effective methods to bring value to class action claimants, often in settlements where they would have otherwise received nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
          In 1981, Jim joined Merrill Lynch and then Shearson/American Express as a retail account executive.  In 1985, Jim joined Fossett Corporation as a market making member of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). During his time working with Steve Fossett, Jim worked the trading pits of the CBOE as Fossett Corporation's Vice President of Trading.  Through his service on several key CBOE committees, he helped build the options industry into the massive derivatives market that we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
          Jim’s dual expertise in trading and class actions made him uniquely qualified to found Chicago Clearing Corporation, in 2005, to help harmed investors recover funds in class action securities settlements. This CCC has become the leading class action securities claim filing service, recovering funds for over 1,260 institutional investors who manage assets in excess of $2.5 trillion. Since 2009, CCC has recovered over $130 million for harmed securities class action litigants. With a growing client list and over $100 billion in expected in settlements in the next decade, that’s just the beginning.
